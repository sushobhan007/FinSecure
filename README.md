## Architecture Overview

The project follows a **microservice-ready modular design** using the **Spring Boot** framework. Here's an overview of the key components:

### Backend
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to services.
- **Service Layer**: Implements the business logic for core functionalities.
- **Repository Layer**: Communicates with the database using JPA/Hibernate.
- **Entities**:
  - **User**: Represents user account details and metadata.
  - **Transaction**: Tracks transaction details and links to user accounts.

### Database
- **Schema**:  
  - `User` table: Stores user-related data, such as personal details, account information, and timestamps.  
  - `Transaction` table: Maintains transaction history with attributes like transaction type, amount, and status.
- **Relationships**:  
  A one-to-many relationship exists between `User` and `Transaction`, linked by the `accountNumber` field.

### Frontend (Planned)
- Built using **React.js** for a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface.

### Key Technologies
- **Java 17** with **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **JPA/Hibernate** for ORM
- **PostgreSQL** (or another relational database)
- **Lombok** for clean code and reduced boilerplate
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Docker** for containerization (planned for deployment)

## Database Design

The application uses a relational database structure with two primary tables:

  +---------------------+       +-----------------------+
  |     Transaction     |       |       User            |
  +---------------------+       +-----------------------+
  | transactionId (PK)  |       | id (PK)               |
  | transactionType     |       | firstName             |
  | amount              |       | middleName            |
  | accountNumber       |<----->| accountNumber         |
  | status              |       | lastName              |
  +---------------------+       | gender                |
                                | address               |
                                | stateOfOrigin         |
                                | accountBalance        |
                                | email                 |
                                | phoneNumber           |
                                | alternativePhoneNumber|
                                | status                |
                                | createdOn             |
                                | lastUpdated           |
                                +-----------------------+
