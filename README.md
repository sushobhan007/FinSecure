## Architecture Overview

The project follows a **microservice-ready modular design** using the **Spring Boot** framework. Here's an overview of the key components:

### Backend
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to services.
- **Service Layer**: Implements the business logic for core functionalities.
- **Repository Layer**: Communicates with the database using JPA/Hibernate.
- **Entities**:
  - **User**: Represents user account details and metadata.
  - **Transaction**: Tracks transaction details and links to user accounts.

### Database
- **Schema**:  
  - `User` table: Stores user-related data, such as personal details, account information, and timestamps.  
  - `Transaction` table: Maintains transaction history with attributes like transaction type, amount, and status.
- **Relationships**:  
  A one-to-many relationship exists between `User` and `Transaction`, linked by the `accountNumber` field.

### Frontend (Planned)
- Built using **React.js** for a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface.

### Key Technologies
- **Java 17** with **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **JPA/Hibernate** for ORM
- **MySQL** (or another relational database)
- **Lombok** for clean code and reduced boilerplate
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Docker** for containerization (planned for deployment)
